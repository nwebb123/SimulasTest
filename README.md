# Simula's Challenge
C# console application to interact with an item only a True Programmer can access.  

## Purpose:
Purpose of this application is to practice general programming skills in C#. Inspired by a challenge from the C# Player's Guide, the guidelines are as follows:

- Build a program that will allow the user to manipulate the chest with lock, unlock, open, and close commands.
- Ensure that the user cannot transition between states that don't support it. For example, if the chest is closed it can be locked or opened, but not unlocked or closed again.
